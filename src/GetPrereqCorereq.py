CMPUT 206 - Introduction to Digital Image Processing


View Available Classes



3 units (fi 6)(EITHER, 3-0-3)
An introduction to basic digital image processing theory, and the tools that make advanced image manipulation possible for ordinary users. Image processing is important in many applications: editing and processing photographs, special effects for movies, drawing animated characters starting with photographs, analyzing and enhancing remote imagery, and detecting suspects from surveillance cameras. Image processing building blocks and fundamental algorithms of image processing operations are introduced using Python libraries. Prerequisites: one of CMPUT 101, 174, or 274; one of MATH 100, 114, 117, 134, 144, or 154; and one of STAT 151, 161, 181, 235, 265, SCI 151, or MATH 181.

3 units (fi 6)(EITHER, 3-0-3)
Faculty of Science

Introduction to the principles, methods, tools, and practices of the professional programmer. The lectures focus on the fundamental principles of software engineering based on abstract data types and their implementations. The laboratories offer an intensive apprenticeship to the aspiring software developer. Students use C and software development tools of the Unix environment. Prerequisite: CMPUT 175. Credit cannot be obtained for CMPUT 201 if credit has been obtained for CMPUT 275, except with permission of the Department.'''

ex5='''CMPUT 174 - Introduction to the Foundations of Computation I
3 units (fi 6)(EITHER, 3-0-3)
Faculty of Science

CMPUT 174 and 175 use a problem-driven approach to introduce the fundamental ideas of Computing Science. 
Emphasis is on the underlying process behind the solution, independent of programming language or style. Basic notions of state, control flow, data structures, recursion, modularization, and testing are introduced through solving simple problems in a variety of domains such as text analysis, map navigation, game search, simulation, and cryptography. Students learn to program by reading and modifying existing programs as well as writing new ones. No prior programming experience is necessary. 
Prerequisite: Math 30, 30-1, or 30-2. See Note (1) above. Credit cannot be obtained for CMPUT 174 if credit has already been obtained for CMPUT 274, 275, or ENCMP 100, except with permission of the Department.'''
